Overview
In this project, I extracted data from multiple datasets based on the most common values and merged them into a single file, "merged_dataset.csv." Afterward, I separated the data into two categories: complete data and incomplete/leaked domains.

Complete Data
Complete data refers to the records where all the required columns—such as domain, address, city, country code, phone, region code, and region name—have valid, non-null values. These rows contain no missing information, ensuring that the dataset is fully intact and provides a comprehensive overview of the domains. This clean dataset is saved in the file "complete_data.csv."

Total Complete Data Entries: 286,325

Incomplete/Leaked Domains
Domains with incomplete data, meaning they have missing or null values in any of the specified columns, are categorized under incomplete data or leaked domains. These rows contain at least one field without valid data, indicating a potential leak or data inconsistency. Only the domain names from this group have been saved in the file "incomplete_domains.csv."

Total Incomplete Data Entries: 203,821

Allocated Time
The entire process, from data extraction and merging to cleaning and categorization, took approximately 4 hours. This reflects my efficiency in executing the project and utilizing advanced data-handling techniques to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

Cleaning Necessity
The datasets provided were purposefully "dirty," containing many incomplete or erroneous records. A crucial step was data cleaning to remove inaccuracies, correct formats, and ensure a reliable output. Cleaning included:

Removing duplicates
Handling null values
Standardizing phone numbers, country codes, and regions
This cleaning step was vital for ensuring the quality of the final dataset, which is crucial for making reliable business decisions.

Business Value
The outcome of this project can create significant business value by providing a clean and organized dataset. With this structured information, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, market reach, and operational strategies. Such data can enhance:

Customer targeting and segmentation
Marketing effectiveness
Strategic decision-making for business expansion
Relevance to Recruitment
This project showcases my ability to manage and process complex data efficiently. The data cleaning, merging, and analysis skills demonstrated here are directly applicable to the role I'm applying for at Veridion. As a data-driven company, the ability to derive meaningful insights from incomplete or "dirty" datasets is crucial, and this project highlights how I can contribute to your data management and analysis efforts.
